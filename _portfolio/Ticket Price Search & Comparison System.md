## Overview

A web-based ticket price search and comparison platform that aggregates pricing information from multiple sources, helping users find the best deals. This project demonstrates skills in web scraping, data aggregation, and creating user-friendly interfaces for complex data.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Price Aggregation**: Collects ticket prices from various platforms
- **Real-Time Search**: Quick search functionality with efficient data retrieval
- **Price Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of prices from different sources
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Advanced filters for date, price range, and destination
- **Caching System**: Optimized performance through intelligent data caching
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for easy navigation

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Web Scraping**: Python libraries for data extraction
- **Database**: SQL Server for price storage and caching
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented efficient web scraping algorithms with rate limiting
- Designed caching mechanism to reduce API calls and improve response time
- Created data normalization pipeline for consistent price comparisons
- Developed robust error handling for unreliable external sources
- Optimized database queries for fast search results

## System Architecture

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Automated scrapers gather price data
2. **Processing Layer**: Normalizes and validates collected data
3. **Storage Layer**: Cached data stored in SQL Server with TTL management
4. **Presentation Layer**: Django views serve processed data to users

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Handling varying data formats from different sources  
**Solution**: Built flexible data parsers with pattern recognition and validation

**Challenge**: Keeping data fresh while minimizing server load  
**Solution**: Implemented intelligent caching with background refresh jobs

**Challenge**: Dealing with rate limits and anti-scraping measures  
**Solution**: Added request throttling, rotating user agents, and polite scraping practices

## Performance Optimizations

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- In-memory caching for popular searches
- Asynchronous data fetching for non-blocking operations
- Lazy loading for improved initial page load times
