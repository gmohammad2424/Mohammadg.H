## Overview

A production-ready file server deployment project on Ubuntu Server, featuring secure file storage, user access management, and automated backup systems. This project demonstrates system administration skills, security implementation, and server infrastructure management.

## Project Scope

Deployed a comprehensive file server solution that provides:
- Centralized file storage for multiple users
- Secure authentication and access control
- Network file sharing (SMB/CIFS, NFS)
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- Remote access capabilities
- Storage monitoring and management

## System Architecture

### Infrastructure
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Server (1 year experience)
- **File System**: EXT4 with proper permissions and quotas
- **Network Protocols**: Samba (SMB/CIFS), NFS, FTP/SFTP
- **Security**: Firewall (UFW), fail2ban, SSL/TLS encryption
- **Backup**: Automated rsync scripts, snapshot management

### Network Configuration
- Static IP assignment
- Port forwarding for remote access
- VPN integration for secure external connections
- DNS configuration for easy access

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server Setup & Configuration

**Base Installation:**
```bash
# System updates and hardening
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install samba nfs-kernel-server vsftpd

# User management
sudo addgroup fileserver-users
sudo usermod -aG fileserver-users username
```

**Storage Configuration:**
- Configured dedicated storage partition
- Set up disk quotas per user
- Implemented RAID (if applicable) for redundancy
- Created directory structure with proper permissions

### 2. Samba File Sharing (Windows/Linux)

**Features Implemented:**
- User authentication with encrypted passwords
- Shared folders with different access levels
- Guest access for public shares (read-only)
- Printer sharing capabilities
- Recycle bin for deleted files

**Sample Configuration:**
```conf
[shared]
    path = /srv/samba/shared
    browseable = yes
    read only = no
    valid users = @fileserver-users
    create mask = 0660
    directory mask = 0770
```

### 3. NFS File Sharing (Linux/Unix)

**Configuration:**
- Exported directories for specific clients
- Performance tuning for large file transfers
- Security through host-based access control

### 4. SFTP/FTP Server

**Secure File Transfer:**
- SSH-based SFTP for encrypted transfers
- Chroot jail for user isolation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Logging for audit trail

### 5. Access Control & Security

**Authentication:**
- User accounts with strong password policies
- SSH key-based authentication
- Integration with existing user directory
- Two-factor authentication (optional)

**Authorization:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained file permissions
- Group-based folder access
- Audit logging for sensitive directories

**Network Security:**
- Firewall rules (UFW) limiting access
- fail2ban for brute-force protection
- SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit
- VPN requirement for external access

### 6. Backup & Disaster Recovery

**Backup Strategy:**
- **Daily Incremental Backups**: Changes only
- **Weekly Full Backups**: Complete system state
- **Off-site Backups**: Remote server synchronization
- **Automated Scripts**: Cron jobs for scheduling

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Automated backup script
rsync -avz --delete /srv/fileserver/ backup@remote:/backups/fileserver/
tar -czf backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz /srv/fileserver/
```

**Recovery Procedures:**
- Documented restore processes
- Tested recovery scenarios
- Snapshot capabilities for quick rollback

### 7. Monitoring & Maintenance

**System Monitoring:**
- Disk space usage alerts
- Service health checks
- Performance metrics (CPU, RAM, I/O)
- User activity logging

**Tools Used:**
- `df`, `du` for disk monitoring
- `htop`, `iotop` for performance
- Log analysis with `grep`, `awk`
- Custom scripts for automated checks

## Performance Optimizations

- Configured Samba for optimal throughput
- Tuned TCP/IP stack for file transfers
- Implemented caching mechanisms
- Load balancing (if multiple servers)
- Compression for backup transfers

## Security Hardening

### System Level
- Disabled root SSH login
- Configured automatic security updates
- Minimized installed packages (attack surface)
- SELinux/AppArmor policies (optional)

### Application Level
- Disabled unnecessary Samba features
- Restricted network protocols
- Configured audit logging
- Regular security patches

### Network Level
- Firewall rules (allow only necessary ports)
- VPN tunnel for remote access
- Network segmentation
- DDoS protection measures

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Managing user permissions across different protocols  
**Solution**: Created centralized user management with synchronized permissions

**Challenge**: Ensuring data integrity during transfers  
**Solution**: Implemented checksums and verification in backup scripts

**Challenge**: Handling large file transfers efficiently  
**Solution**: Tuned buffer sizes and enabled jumbo frames on network

**Challenge**: Balancing accessibility with security  
**Solution**: Implemented VPN access with multi-factor authentication

## Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Tasks
- Monitor system logs for errors
- Check backup completion status
- Verify disk space availability

### Weekly Tasks
- Review user access logs
- Test backup restore procedure
- Update security patches

### Monthly Tasks
- Rotate log files
- Audit user accounts
- Performance review and optimization

## Results & Impact

- Successfully deployed secure file server serving multiple users
- Achieved 99.9% uptime through proper monitoring
- Zero data loss due to robust backup strategy
- Reduced file sharing complexity for team members
- Improved collaboration through centralized storage

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **System Administration**: Ubuntu Server management and configuration
- **Networking**: Protocol configuration, firewall setup, VPN integration
- **Security**: Access control, encryption, hardening practices
- **Automation**: Bash scripting for backups and maintenance
- **Troubleshooting**: Log analysis and problem resolution
- **Documentation**: Creating runbooks and procedures
