# Hello! I'm Mohammad 👋

I'm a final-year **Computer Engineering** student at **Sharif University of Technology**, one of Iran's most prestigious technical universities. My journey in technology is driven by a simple philosophy: **"For any problem, there is always a solution. Let's find it out."**

## What I Do

I specialize in **backend development** with a strong foundation in **Python** and **Django**, but my interests extend far beyond just writing code. I'm passionate about:

- 🔧 **Backend Development**: Building robust, scalable server-side applications
- 🌐 **Networking**: Understanding and managing network infrastructure
- 🔒 **Cybersecurity**: Protecting systems and exploring security best practices
- 📊 **Algorithm Optimization**: Making systems faster and more efficient
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Leveraging AI tools to solve real-world problems

## My Experience

During my academic journey, I completed a **3-month internship at Dotin Company** in the Smart Data Department, where I worked on **API management for machine learning systems**. This experience gave me hands-on exposure to production-level software development and the intersection of backend engineering with ML infrastructure.

## Technical Expertise

Over the past few years, I've built a diverse skill set:

- **Programming**: Python (2+ years), C/C++ (4 years), with experience in Django framework
- **Database Management**: SQL Server (3 years of experience)
- **System Administration**: Ubuntu & Ubuntu Server management (1 year)
- **Network Engineering**: VPN server management (3 years), MikroTik basics, routing protocols
- **Web Technologies**: HTML & CSS (2 years)
- **Security**: Cybersecurity fundamentals (3 months focused study)

## What Drives Me

I'm not just a student who learns from books—I'm a **problem solver** who loves tackling complex challenges. Whether it's optimizing an algorithm to run in near-real-time, deploying a file server, or managing VPN infrastructure, I find satisfaction in making things work efficiently.

Beyond coding, I enjoy:
- 🚴 **Biking and high-speed driving** - the thrill of speed and precision
- 🍰 **Baking** - experimenting with new recipes
- 🧩 **Solving complex problems** - both in code and in life
- 🌟 **Trying new things** - constantly learning and exploring

## My Philosophy

I believe in being in the right place—not more, not less. I focus on continuous learning and practical application of knowledge. Currently, while I'm freelancing, my primary focus is on completing my degree and building a strong foundation for my career.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing technology, collaborating on projects, or exploring new opportunities. Feel free to check out my [projects](/portfolio/) or reach out through my [contact information](/contact/).
